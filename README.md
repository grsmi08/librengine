# LibrEngine

This repository is based on 3d-planet-OpenGL and is made to allow the easy creation of 3d spaces through a .json file.
Currently has very few features.
Models must have an .obj file (with respectable geometry), an .mtl file, and a singular baked texture.
Use the provided scene.json as an example
